# HandwrittenDigitClassification
Using handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset to be able to train a model to recognise the handwritten digits


The main problem that we are trying to solve here would be to identify handwritten digits. This can be made used in banks for a machine to read through a cheque to avoid the necessity for human presence to verify the transaction, this way the process will also be fast and not require any additional costs for the bank. It could also be used by police to get the number plate digits of fast paced cars
